# FileLibrary Class

The `FileLibrary` class is designed to manage car records stored in various file formats including text, XML, and binary. It offers functionalities to read, update, add, and delete car records from different file formats. The class aims to provide abstraction over file I/O operations, making it easier for users to work with car records in different formats.

## Architecture Description

The class is structured to support operations for different file formats:

### Text Files

- `ReadFromTextFile(name)`: Reads car records from a text file with the specified name. Handles date format validation and exception handling.
- `UpdateRecordFile(id)`: Updates a car record identified by its ID in memory.
- `WriteToTextFile()`: Writes the in-memory car records back to the text file.
- `AddRecordTextFile()`: Adds a new car record to the in-memory collection.
- `DeleteRecordFile(id)`: Deletes a car record identified by its ID from the in-memory collection.

### XML Files

- `WriteToXmlFile()`: Creates an XML document and writes car records to an XML file.
- `UpdateRecordXmlFile(id)`: Updates a car record in an XML file identified by its ID.
- `DeleteRecordXmlFile(id)`: Deletes a car record from an XML file identified by its ID.
- `AddRecordXmlFile()`: Adds a new car record to an XML file.

### Binary Files

- `WriteToBinaryFile()`: Writes car records to a binary file with custom binary formatting.
- `ReadFromBinFile(binfilename)`: Reads car records from a binary file with custom binary parsing.

## Strengths

- **Versatility**: Supports multiple file formats, allowing users to choose the format that suits their needs.
- **Abstraction**: Encapsulates file I/O operations, simplifying interaction with different file formats.
- **Extensibility**: Separates operations by format, facilitating the addition of new formats or operations.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling to address format-related issues.
- **Clear Structure**: Organizes methods by format, enhancing code readability.

## Weaknesses

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The class appears to have multiple responsibilities; consider decomposing it further.
- **Code Duplication**: Some code repetition exists; consolidate common code to improve maintainability.
- **Exception Handling**: Clarity is needed regarding whether the class should handle or propagate exceptions.
- **Limited Validation**: Additional input validation could improve user experience.
- **Security**: Lacks security measures, such as data encryption for binary files.

## Future Development

- **Refactoring**: Refactor the class to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, splitting it into smaller, focused classes or methods.
- **Validation**: Enhance input validation for improved data correctness.
- **Consolidation**: Reduce code duplication by centralizing error handling and date parsing.
- **Encapsulation**: Minimize public fields, expose functionality through methods, and use private fields.
- **Error Messages**: Provide descriptive error messages for user understanding.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement security measures like encryption for sensitive data in binary files.
